# College Wireless Network Design, Simulation, and Analysis 

## Project Summary

This projecr documents the design, implementation, and analysis of a secure wireless network infrastructure for a college campus environment, performed as a core assignment during Bachelor's degree coursework. The project utilized a network simulation tool to model the connectivity, security, and performance of the wireless access points and backbone network.

## Technical Scope & Components

The primary output is the configuration and analysis derived from the network simulation:

* Simulation Tool: Cisco Packet Tracer

* Key Configurations: Access Point (AP) placement, IP addressing scheme, firewall/ACL rules for traffic control, and SSID broadcast management.

* Analysis: Performance metrics studied: latency, throughput, jitter, and successful connection rates under simulated load.

## Key Professional Learnings

* Practical Networking Skills: Gained hands-on experience in designing and configuring a complex, multi-layered campus network environment.

* Troubleshooting and Optimization: Developed skills in identifying and resolving common network issues (e.g., overlapping IP ranges, spanning-tree loops, wireless coverage gaps).

* Policy and Compliance: Ensured the design adhered to established security and operational policies suitable for an educational institution.
