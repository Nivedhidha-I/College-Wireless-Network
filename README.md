# College Wireless Network Design, Simulation, and Analysis 

## Project Summary

This repository documents the design, implementation, and analysis of a secure wireless network infrastructure for a college campus environment, performed as a core assignment during Bachelor's degree coursework. The project utilized a network simulation tool (implied by the .pkt file) to model the connectivity, security, and performance of the wireless access points and backbone network.

The objective was to apply foundational networking principles to create a scalable, high-availability wireless solution capable of supporting hundreds of concurrent users across different departmental and administrative VLANs.

## Network Engineering Focus

This project demonstrates strong practical and theoretical knowledge in essential networking disciplines:

* Network Design Principles: Applied best practices for hierarchical network design (Access, Distribution, Core layers) to ensure scalability and manageability.

* Wireless Protocol Mastery: Configured and analyzed Wi-Fi standards (e.g., 802.11n/ac) including channel planning, coverage optimization, and power settings to minimize interference and maximize throughput.

* Security Implementation: Implemented robust security protocols, including WPA2-Enterprise with a RADIUS server (simulated), to ensure user authentication and data confidentiality.

* VLAN and Subnetting: Designed and implemented a structured IP addressing scheme using VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) and VLAN segmentation to isolate user, faculty, and administrative traffic.

## Technical Scope & Components

The primary output is the configuration and analysis derived from the network simulation:

* Simulation Tool: Cisco Packet Tracer (or equivalent)

* Design Focus: Wireless LAN (WLAN) coverage, QoS, and redundancy.

* Protocols Configured: 802.1Q (VLAN Tagging), 802.1D/W (Spanning Tree), WPA2-Enterprise, DHCP, Static Routing.

* Key Configurations: Access Point (AP) placement, IP addressing scheme, firewall/ACL rules for traffic control, and SSID broadcast management.

* Analysis: Performance metrics studied: latency, throughput, jitter, and successful connection rates under simulated load.

## Key Professional Learnings

* Practical Networking Skills: Gained hands-on experience in designing and configuring a complex, multi-layered campus network environment.

* Troubleshooting and Optimization: Developed skills in identifying and resolving common network issues (e.g., overlapping IP ranges, spanning-tree loops, wireless coverage gaps).

* Policy and Compliance: Ensured the design adhered to established security and operational policies suitable for an educational institution.
